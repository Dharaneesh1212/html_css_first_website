          If someone wanted to build a website, they might hire a front-end
          developer to create the site's layout. The front-end developer
          determines where to place images, what the navigation should look
          like, and how to present the site. Much of their work involves
          ensuring the appearance and layout of the site or application is easy
          to navigate and intuitive for the user.

          Back-end development means working on server-side software, which
          focuses on everything you canâ€™t see on a website. Back-end developers
          ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end
          logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and
          servers. They use code that helps browsers communicate with databases,
          store, understand, and delete data. On a team, back-end developers
          collaborate with front-end developers, product managers, principal
          architects, and website testers to build the structure of a website or
          mobile app. Back-end developers must be familiar with many kinds of
          tools and frameworks, including languages such as Python, Java, and
          Ruby. They make sure the back-end performs quickly and responsively to
          front-end user requests.

        <p class="table-para3">
          A full-stack developer is a developer or engineer who can build both
          the front end and the back end of a website. The front end (the parts
          of a website a user sees and interacts with) and the back end (the
          behind-the-scenes data storage and processing) require different skill
          sets. Since full-stack developers are involved with all aspects of the
          development process, they must have expertise in both. A full-stack
          developer can work in-house or at a computer development company that
          engineers websites, software, and other components for other
          businesses.
